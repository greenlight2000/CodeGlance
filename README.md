# CodeGance
CodeGlance is a multi-dimensional benchmark investigating code reasoning challenges across three realistic scenarios:
intrinsic logic reasoning, API interaction reasoning, and unseen function reasoning. 

This repository includes replication prompts and five CodeGlance [datasets](./data) with code-feature annotations: Cruxeval, DS1000_reasoning, MonkBeatEval_reasoning, PanNumEval_reasoning, and torchdata_reasoning.
